            This phase includes states representing your active backlog, cards that are at the design or definition
            stage, and cards that are ready for development.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a card is initially created, it starts in this phase and it marks the start of a
            <em> delivery cycle </em> for the card. The lead time clock starts ticking at this point.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cycle time clock starts ticking whenever a card exits this phase. It stops ticking when it re-enters
            this phase.

            This phase is meant for cards that are under development but are not currently being worked on by anyone.
          </p>
          <p>Blocked cards, cards waiting for code-review etc belong here.</p>
          <p>Lead and cycle time clocks continue to tick in this phase.</p>

          <p>This phase is meant for cards where implementation has begun.</p>
          <p>Cards that have been marked "in-progress" by developers belong here.</p>
          <p>
            When a card exits this phase it is considered code-complete: all code is reviewed and merged into an
            integration branch and is available to downstream stakeholders.

          <p>This phase is meant for code-complete cards that are ready for QA and delivery to production.</p>
          <p>
            If you have a manual QA or acceptance stage, prior to deployment then any workflow states that track this
            acceptance process belong here.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you continuously deploy code merged into a release branch to production and do acceptance in production,
            your deployed-to-production state should be mapped to this phase.
